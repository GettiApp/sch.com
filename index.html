    <p>Melon Sandbox, formerly known as Melon Playground, has been unjustly removed from the Google Play Store due to a false copyright claim.</p>
    <p>This creative sandbox game allows players to experiment with physics and build unique contraptions. The removal is a blow to the game's developers and the gaming community.</p>
    <p>We urge you to help raise awareness about this issue! Share this website and use the hashtag #SaveMelonSandbox on social media.</p>
    <p>Let's work together to get Melon Sandbox back on the Google Play Store!</p>
